## 2026-02-21 - [Caching local icon resolution]
**Learning:** Resolving local application icons by scanning `/Applications` and checking for existence of paths is a significant disk I/O bottleneck, especially when scrolling through long lists of packages. Using `static let` for a one-time directory listing cache and `NSCache` for resolved paths significantly reduces UI lag.
**Action:** Always prefer caching filesystem metadata and path resolution results when they are used in high-frequency UI paths like list rendering.
